<h1>WELCOME !!</h1>

These are the projects that I have worked on in this term using react.

1) TODO APPLICATION:
   - A fully functional todo app that uses local storage to store data.
   - It can add delete and edit the todos.
   - Contains all your todo even after reloading the page.

2) POKEDEX:
   - This is a pokedex containing informmation of all the pokemon.
   - you can click on any pokemon and reveal complete information on that pokemon.
   - it uses an api (ex : "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/ditto") to retrieve all the information.
   - It also uses a cached local storage so that you don't end up calling the api again and again for the same pokemon and get banned from the api host.
